1. [Register](https://forms.gle/SSaHD1uzcDGcdJxZ9) for each hackathon you'd like to participate in. During registration, you will be asked to submit an initial project idea that you would be interested in working on during the hackathon. All ideas will be made available for discussion in a dedicated Slack channel. You will receive an invite to that channel as part of an onboarding email after registering.
2. Attend the ideation and mixer event. The event allows participants to present and discuss their ideas. It also provides the opportunity to form teams for the upcoming hackathon.
3. Attend the team curation event. During this event, teams will pitch their ideas and plans for the hackathon. The best ideas will be invited to the hackathon to realize their vision. The decision criteria will be announced before the event.
4. Work on your project during the hackathon.
5. Present your project during the hackathon demo session. The best project will receive funding from the Block Center to continue working on it.
